# Storyline Testing Strategy

## Executive Summary
This document outlines a comprehensive 8-week testing strategy to bring Storyline from its current 30% test coverage to production-ready status. The strategy prioritizes risk mitigation, user safety, and core functionality validation while establishing sustainable testing practices.

## Current State Assessment
- **Overall Test Coverage**: ~30%
- **Critical Gaps**: Voice processing (0%), AI orchestrator (0%), Web app (0%), Authentication (0%)
- **Strengths**: Emotional safety tests (100%), Memory service (good coverage)
- **Production Readiness**: BLOCKED due to untested core services

## Testing Philosophy
1. **Risk-Based Prioritization**: Focus on user safety, then core features, then enhancements
2. **Incremental Coverage**: Build from unit → integration → end-to-end → performance
3. **Automation First**: All tests must run in CI/CD pipeline
4. **Production Validation**: Tests should reflect real-world usage patterns

### Contingency Plans
- **Timeline Slippage**: Prioritize auth + voice for MVP
- **Resource Constraints**: Focus on automated tests over manual
- **Technical Blockers**: Maintain list of "test later" items

## Long-Term Testing Strategy

### Continuous Improvement
- Monthly test health reviews
- Quarterly performance baseline updates  
- Semi-annual demographic revalidation
- Annual security penetration testing

### Test Maintenance
- Flaky test detection and quarantine
- Test execution time monitoring (<10 min for unit tests)
- Regular test refactoring sprints
- Documentation updates with code changes

### Production Validation
- Synthetic monitoring for critical paths
- Real user monitoring for performance
- A/B testing framework for new features
- Incident postmortems drive new tests

## Next Steps
1. Set up GitHub Actions CI pipeline
2. Create test data collection plan
3. Install missing test dependencies
4. Begin Phase 1 implementation
5. Schedule weekly test review meetings
